World of unicast routing is well habitated. There are lots of uinicast routing
protocols with completely divergent approaches. When it comes to routing
multicast traffic, much is different.

As multicast was added as an extension to IPv4, there was lack of support on
network nodes -- and multicast is one of those things that needs all nodes to
support it, or doesn't work at all. In the first chapter I would like to % ref: first chapter
explain how multicast and multicast routing works in general.

The protocol chosen for this thesis is PIM-BIDIR. It is somehow simplified
protocol from the PIM family, because it doesn't need to hold state information
based on traffic source. That makes it less demanding on network hardware.
Second chapter is dedicated to explaining how protocol works. % ref second chapter

My goal didn't contain writing standalone multicast router application. There
are multiple of those already (none well known doing PIM-BIDIR though). Some
advantages come from having unicast and multicast routing in one daemon, so the
goal was to extend BIRD. It was school project similar to mine, but grew to
worldwide use. In third chapter you can find overview of current BIRD % ref: third chapter
architecture.

Finally, there were decisions made in implementing multicast routing into BIRD.
These are summarized in the fourth chapter.
